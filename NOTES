x 1. Change user page to only display name and count of movie_reviews
    - add "Show Reviews" button, that displays the users reviews
      via jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend

x 2. When looking at a single movie review:
    - add "Next Review" button, that cycles through all comments
      fetched and rendered via jQuery/AJAX.

x 3. Change movie show page to only show the first review for that movie
    - add "Show All Reviews" button, that displays all reviews
      for that movie with jQuery/AJAX.
      ----****--add serializer for movie, with has_many :reviews

x 4. Change movie review form to submit review via an AJAX POST request
    - review would be serialized, then submitted via AJAX POST request
      with the response being the new object in JSON and then appending
      that new comment to the DOM using JavaScript (ES6 Template Literals
      can help out a lot with this).

x 5. Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects.
      The Model Objects must have at least one method on the prototype.
      Formatters work really well for this. Borrowing from the previous
      example, instead of plainly taking the JSON response of the newly
      created comment and appending it to the DOM, you would create a
      Comment prototype object and add a function to that prototype to
      perhaps concatenate (format) the comments authors first and last name.
      You would then use the object to append the comment information to
      the DOM.

  6. Movie review new form, clear form so you can make more reviews
      without refreshing.

  7. ES6 syntax error already defined Review

  8. Change "each" in javascript file and script tags
    http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/

  9. Sched. next time: hoisting scope.

  10. Add some styling. Maybe bootstrap
